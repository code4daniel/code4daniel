# Hey, I'm Daniel

I'm a frontend developer who enjoys designing and building simple, useful interfaces. I started out with curiosity—trying to figure out how websites and apps worked—and over time, that turned into a genuine interest in UI design and web development.

Most of my work revolves around React, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. I also work on the backend when needed, mostly using Node.js and MongoDB, especially for small to mid-sized projects where I want full control over how things run.

Whether it’s a blog for an artist, a school fee tracking system, or a movie streaming app, I try to build things that are practical, easy to use, and focused on solving real needs.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually refining my process—organizing design systems in Figma or exploring better ways to manage state and performance.

Thanks for stopping by.
